## What's the size of this dataset? (i.e., how many trips)

`983648`
 

    #standardSQL
    SELECT count(*) FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_trips`


## What is the earliest start time and latest end time for a trip?

`2013-08-29 09:08:00` 
`2016-08-31 23:48:00`


    #standardSQL
    SELECT min(start_date) 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_trips`

    #standardSQL
    SELECT max(end_date) 
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_trips`

## How many bikes are there?

`700`

    #standardSQL
    SELECT count(distinct bike_number)
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_trips`

## Housekeeping

- Channel etiquette

## Activities: async content

## 

- This week, videos about various tools you can use to work with your data 
- Working with files: json, csv etc
- So for  today's class activity, weâ€™re  going to work with some command line tools to manipulate data in some handy  ways.


#
## Finding stuff out about your data

## Download Datasets

Save data into your `w205` directory
```
cd ~/w205
curl -L -o annot_fpid.json https://goo.gl/qWiu7d
curl -L -o lp_data.csv https://goo.gl/FDFPYB
```

::: notes
make sure they go into `~/w205` on your cloud instance.

i.e., `cd w205` first
:::

## Install jq


- `sudo apt update`

- `sudo apt install jq`

## What's in this file?

`head lp_data.csv`

`tail lp_data.csv`

::: notes

- Lots of csvs and tsvs I get sent/access to have e.g., 17M rows
- I don't want to have to open that or `cat` it or even `| less`
:::

## What are variables in here?

`head -n1 lp_data.csv`

::: notes


:::

## How many entries?

`cat lp_data.csv | wc -l`

::: notes

- 100 rows
:::

## How about sorting?

`cat lp_data.csv | sort`

::: notes

- it sorts by usage
- but it's treating numbers weird
:::

## Take a look at what options there are for sort

`man sort`

::: notes

- Ask them to generate options

    -g, --general-numeric-sort
    compare according to general numerical value

     -n, --numeric-sort
    compare according to string numerical value
:::


## fix so sorting correctly

`cat lp_data.csv | sort -g`

`cat lp_data.csv | sort -n`


# 

## Find out which topics are more popular

## What have we got in this file?

`head annot_fpid.json`

::: notes

- It will scroll all over the page, 
- b/c it's json, it's just one line, so head is everything
:::

## Hmmm, what now? jq

pretty print the json


`cat annot_fpid.json | jq .`

::: notes

- There's a slide for a jq reference at the end here, we're just going to do a little in class
:::

## Just the terms

`cat annot_fpid.json | jq '.[][]'`

::: notes

- 
:::

## Remove the ""s

`cat annot_fpid.json | jq '.[][]' -r`

::: notes

- 
:::

## Can we sort that?

`cat annot_fpid.json | jq '.[][]' -r | sort `

::: notes

- Hmmm, there's lots of repeated terms
:::

## Unique values only

    cat annot_fpid.json | jq '.[][]' -r | 
    sort | uniq 

::: notes

- 
:::

## How could I find out how many of each of those unique values there are?

    cat annot_fpid.json | jq '.[][]' -r | 
    sort | uniq -c 

::: notes

- 
:::

## Now, how could I sort by that?


    cat annot_fpid.json | jq '.[][]' -r | 
    sort | uniq -c | sort -g

Ascending

    cat annot_fpid.json | jq '.[][]' -r | 
    sort | uniq -c | sort -gr

Descending

::: notes

- 
:::

## So, what are the top ten terms?

    cat annot_fpid.json | jq '.[][]' -r | 
    sort | uniq -c | sort -gr | head -10

## bq cli




##

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false '
SELECT count(*)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_status`'
```

::: notes
107,501,619

The point: you can use `select *` to actually answer questions.

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT count(*) FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_status`'
```
:::

## How many stations are there?

##

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false '
SELECT count(distinct station_id)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_status`'
```

::: notes
The point: how to count unique
Answer: something like 75

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT count(distinct station_id) FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_status`'
```
:::


## How long a time period do these data cover?

##

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false '
SELECT min(time), max(time)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_status`'
```


::: notes
- 2013-08-29 12:06:01.000 UTC   
- 2016-08-31 23:58:59.000 UTC   

```
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'SELECT min(time), max(time) FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.bikeshare_status`'
```

## Generate Ideas

- What do you know?
- What will you need to find out?

::: notes

- breakout
- Generate Ideas = get them going on generating questions for project 
- If they don't come up with anything, ask:
  1. What do you know?
    * i.e., what variables do you have? what do they mean? 
  2. What will you need to find out?
    * i.e., how to use those variables in some combo to figure out:
    * What's a trip?
    * What's a commuter trip?
    * etc

#
## Summary
- Command line tools and jq to dive into your data
- BigQuery from the command line

## Onward

- This week's videos may seem like kind of a mixed bag. 
- Starting to transition between Project 1 & Project 2. 
- Working with query tools (bigquery and Athena)
- Getting a glimpse of how to use jupyter notebooks for Project 1
- Looking ahead at some bits of docker manipulation from the command line, getting ready for Project 2. 
- Also you'll see your first supplemental tag


#
## Extras

::: notes
- All of this is stuff you can use or not.
:::

## Resources

## sed and awk

<http://www.catonmat.net/blog/awk-one-liners-explained-part-one/>
<http://www.catonmat.net/blog/sed-one-liners-explained-part-one/>

## jq

<https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/>

## Advanced options 

## Sort by 'product_name'

```
cat lp_data.csv | awk -F',' '{ print $2,$1 }' | sort
```

::: notes
```
cat lp_data.csv | awk -F',' '{ print $2,$1 }' | sort
```

- Put in extras for add ons or activities if folks finish early

- This switches the columns and sorts on LP title
- but you find out that some LPs have ""s around the titles
:::


## Fix the ""s issue

```
cat lp_data.csv  | awk -F',' '{ print $2,$1 }' | sed 's/"//' | sort | less
```

::: notes
```
cat lp_data.csv  | awk -F',' '{ print $2,$1 }' | sed 's/"//' | sort | less
```

- the sed part here takes out the "" 
- and then we sort based on title
