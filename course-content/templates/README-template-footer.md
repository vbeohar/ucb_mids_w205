## Avoiding Plagiarism
Plagiarism is a serious academic offense, and students must take care not to copy code written by others. Beginning students sometimes have trouble identifying exactly when plagiarism takes place. Remember that it is generally fine to search for examples of code (for example, on forums like stackoverflow). This is a normal part of programming and can help you learn. However, it is important that you understand the code you find and use what you learn to write your own statements. If in doubt, simply document the place you found your example code and ask your instructors for further guidance.
